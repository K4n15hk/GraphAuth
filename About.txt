GraphAuth is an image based authentication tool.
It can be added to any program to provide a layer of security.
Right now it creates a database file in the current directory in which the script is present.
To create the database,you have to run database_creator_cum_checker app.


Features of the tool:


1)It takes care that only valid usernames are allowed to be entered.These imply that the names should be without spaces,and the name field must not be empty.

2)While signing up when you upload the image and click on the corresponding submit button,it checks if the file is an image file or not and prints an appropriate message.

3)All the process happens through a very user_friendly interface.You only have to use the keyboard while typing your username.

4)It uses a novel hashing algorithm for authentication.The algorithm takes into account both the sequence and the image in that sequence to create the hash.
