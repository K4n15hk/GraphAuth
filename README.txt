Graph_Auth is an image based authentication tool
I have presented it in two forms:
One is a standalone application and
Second is as a python module that can be imported and used as a security layer for the rest of your code


Before running my tool you must run the database_creator_cum_checker to create the database required for my program.


The tool returns the following when it is run:


True:If the  user is successfully authenticated
False:If the user is not authenticated
5:If the sign_up application is run
404:If the user account is locked
NONE:If any other case or if access is denied

I am providing a trial.py file to demonstrate how you can use my tool in your code.
